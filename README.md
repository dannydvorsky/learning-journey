# 🚀 My Learning Journey with GitHub, JavaScript & MongoDB

Welcome to my public learning repository! 🎓 This repo serves as a **progress tracker** and **study log** as I navigate through my learning journey in **Git, JavaScript, TypeScript, MongoDB, and backend development**.

## 📌 About This Repo

This repository is where I:
- Document my progress in various courses 📚
- Share insights and reflections on key concepts 📝
- Track my milestones in programming and development 💡
- Experiment with new technologies and best practices 🛠️

All code and learning notes here are intended as a **learning resource** rather than production-ready solutions.

## 🏁 Current Learning Focus

I’m currently working on:
- **Git & GitHub**: Collaboration workflows, GitHub Actions, CI/CD
- **JavaScript & TypeScript**: Advanced JS concepts, TypeScript integration
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL schema design, CRUD operations, indexing, and aggregation
- **Backend Development**: APIs, Express.js, and working with cloud services

You can check my **[task list](./task-list.md)** for detailed progress tracking.
